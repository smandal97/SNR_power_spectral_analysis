# Power Spectral Analysis of Supernova Remnants.
Tools for predicting power spectrum of a supernova remnant given its dynamical age.
The checkpoint or CP number contains time information. To convert from CP no. to time in code units (t/T in paper), use:
                                                  t/T = 10.**(-4.+(CP#)/10.)
